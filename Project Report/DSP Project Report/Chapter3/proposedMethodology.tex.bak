\chapter{Proposed Methodology}
\label{chap3}
In the previous chapter, we have discussed the theories that support this research related to the Electronic Voting Machine . In this chapter we will proposed our methodology for this project.
\section{Block Diagram}
Let us look at the simplified block diagram in Figure \ref{blockDiagram}, which illustrates the main components involved
in Electronic Voting Machine(EVM) Using 8051 Micro-controller. Switches are used to make choices, resister, capacitor, and oscillator are being used to work the micro-controller properly on the circuits with the help of connecting wires.

\section{About Microcontroller (AT89C51)}
\subsection{Features of AT89C51}
Following are some of the main feature of the used microcontroller i.e, AT89C51:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 128 bytes of RAM for storing running program
%
\item 32 I/O lines for communicating with other devices
%
\item two 16-bit timer/counters
%
\item a five vector two-level interrupt architecture
%
\item a full duplex serial port, on-chip oscillator and clock circuitry
%
\end{enumerate}

\section{Components Selection}

\subsection{Software Selection}
To simulate our project, we have used proteus, the Proteus Design Suite is a proprietary software tool suite used primarily for electronic design automation. The software is used mainly by electronic design engineers and technicians to create schematics and electronic prints for manufacturing printed circuit boards. \begin{figure}[H]  %h=positioning
